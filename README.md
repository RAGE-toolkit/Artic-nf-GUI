# ðŸ§¬ Artic-nf (RAGE-toolkit)

This pipeline performs **basecalling, demultiplexing, alignment, variant calling, consensus generation, and multiple sequence alignment** for viral genomes from **Nanopore sequencing data**.  

It supports both **Dorado** and **Guppy** basecallers, and can run either with **Docker** or **Conda** environments.  
The pipeline automatically selects the correct container image depending on your system architecture (`arm64/aarch64` or `x86_64`).
