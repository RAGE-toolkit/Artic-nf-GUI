# 🧬 Artic-nf (RAGE-toolkit)

Artic-nf-GUI is a graphical user interface (GUI) for the Artic-nf workflow, designed to integrate with Oxford Nanopore’s EPI2ME platform.

⚠️ Note: This project is currently under active development. At present, basecalling modules such as Dorado and Guppy are not supported within the GUI. Users should provide pre-basecalled FASTQ files (e.g., from a fastq_pass directory) as input to run the workflow.

The pipeline automatically selects the correct container image depending on your system architecture (`arm64/aarch64` or `x86_64`).

## 📦 Requirements

- ⚠️ Note: This workflow has been developed and tested using EPI2ME Desktop v5.2.5 on an Apple M3 Pro system. It is expected that other Apple Silicon (ARM64) platforms will also support successful execution.
A corresponding Docker image is available for Linux (Ubuntu), and while the workflow is likely to run on Linux systems, this has not yet been formally tested.
